I'm a PhD student in the [Visual Informatics Laboratory](https://liv.ic.unicamp.br/) and [Reasoning for Complex Data](https://recod.ai/) groups at [Instituto de Computação](https://ic.unicamp.br/), [Unicamp](https://www.unicamp.br/).

Amazonian with pride, doing a Ph.D. in computer science, but with the soul of an engineer, who likes the practical side and taking things out into the real world. Interested in all things artificial intelligence, deep neural networks and their applications, currently focusing on problems of visual question answering and concept understanding.
