# Contributing to multi-language-al-folio

Thank you for considering contributing to al-folio or its multilingual version! Please check if your contribution is related to the template itself or to the multilingual aspect of it. If it is the former, please consider doing it in the original [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/) repository. If it is the latter, follow the instructions below.

## Pull Requests

We welcome your pull requests (PRs).
For minor fixes (e.g., documentation improvements), feel free to submit a PR directly.
If you would like to implement a new feature or a bug, please make sure you (or someone else) has opened an appropriate issue first; in your PR, please mention the issue it addresses.

Note that since [#2048](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/pull/2048) al-folio uses the [prettier formatter](https://prettier.io/) for its code, meaning all new submitted code must conform to its standard. If you don't have `prettier` installed for your setup and the `prettier` code check fails when submitting a PR, you can check the referred failed action in our repo. In that action there will be an artifact with an HTML diff showing the needed changes.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests.
Before submitting an issue, please make sure:

1. You have read [the FAQ section](FAQ.md) of the README and your question is NOT addressed there.
2. You have done your best to ensure that your issue is NOT a duplicate of one of [the previous issues](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/issues).
3. Your issue is either a bug (unexpected/undesirable behavior) or a feature request.
   If it is just a question, please ask it in the [Discussions](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio/discussions) forum.

When submitting an issue, please make sure to use the appropriate template.
